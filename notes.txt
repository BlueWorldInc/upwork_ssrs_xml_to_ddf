I had hard time making this work because I was using 
Set HttpReq = CreateObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP") // which is the first link in google for "vba download file"
instead of 
Set HttpReq= CreateObject("WinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1") // https://stackoverrun.com/fr/q/10558050

Now everything work smoothly.
